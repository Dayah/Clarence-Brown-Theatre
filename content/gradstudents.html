While in Las Vegas, he worked at the "Star Trek:  The Experience" attraction at the Hilton, playing a Klingon.</p>
<p>Steven did lots of acting in junior high and high school, and has been able to make a living as an actor since 1990.  Steven met UT faculty member Beth Craven, while working with her on a production in Las Vegas.  He was looking for a graduate program, and Beth encouraged him to consider UT.</p>

<p><?= Image("Rebecca Eddy", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Rebecca Eddy</strong> was born and raised in Colorado.  She has lived in Alaska, Washington, DC, Boston and New York City since finishing her BFA in theatre at the University of Colorado, Boulder.</p>
<p>Her father took her to a production of <i>Two Gentleman of Verona</i> at the Denver Center when she was in grade school, and from then on she was interested in theatre. She says, "One late night rehearsing <i>Equus</i> in high school, the smell of the theatre, the dust floating through the lights and the concentration and silence of a group of people 'playing' made me want to be an actor."</p>
<p>Rebecca was attracted to the graduate program at UT because of "the international aspect of the program, the focus on world theatre, and theatre as a life, not just a profession."  She also says that she got "wonderful vibes" from Terry Weber and Beth Craven at her audition.  Rebecca would like to be a working actor upon graduation, performing around the country in regional theatres and developing her own independent projects.</p>

<p><?= Image("Jeremy Fischer", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Jeremy Fischer</strong> is originally from Houston, TX, but has lived and acted for the past four years in New York City.  He received a BA in theatre from the University of Texas at Austin.</p>
<p>Jeremy became interested in acting when he saw his high school's production of <i>Brigadoon</i>, in which his girlfriend at the time was performing.  He says "that night I decided that I could do better than half of the people in the show, so I enrolled in an acting class at the school, and the acting bug bit me from there."</p>
<p>There were several things that attracted Jeremy to UT's graduate program. The first thing that attracted him was the focus on international training, with which he has had no experience at all.  In addition, his father's family members all live in Memphis, and his in-laws live in Cincinnati, so coming to Knoxville offered a chance to be closer to family.</p>
<p>His goals after leaving the program are to secure a teaching position on the university level, "teaching acting or any other skill I may have acquired at UT."  He says, "I also hope to continue lifting my own acting career, spiritually and artistically, and be a working theatre professional in every sense of that term."</p>

<p><?= Image("Faezeh Jalali", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Faezeh Jalali</strong> is from Bombay, India. She went to Beloit College in Wisconsin, and graduated last May with a BA in theatre arts with acting and directing concentrations.  Faezeh says, "I have always loved acting.  I did many performances for family and friends as a kid, and got involved in a lot of plays in school and college."  She was attracted to the international component of the graduate program at UT, and attributes her decision to come here to "a great audition" with Blake Robison and Beth Craven.</p>
<p>When she finishes the graduate program, Faezeh plans to go back to India and start a company and also teach theatre and work with street kids.</p>

<p><?= Image("Collin D. Martin", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Collin D. Martin</strong> was born in Steven's Point, WI.  He lived many years in Memphis, TN and Miami, FL, but did most of his growing up in north Alabama.  He received an associate's degree in theatre from Calhoun Community College in Decatur, AL and finished his bachelor's degree at the University of North Alabama.</p>
<p>When asked how he got involved in acting, Collin says, "I love movies.  I love the escape that movies give. Growing up, I was the child that imitated or quoted movies in school and at home.  My parents were always pressing me to pursue an acting career, but I didn't have confidence in myself to pursue such a career."  Instead, after high school, he pursued his interest in science and biology.  He says, "Growing up, my hero was Jack Hannah, the director of the Columbus Zoo in Ohio.  He was always seen on the late night talk shows, educating the public on different species of animals.  I wanted to be like Jack Hannah.  But after several years of chemistry I knew that my dreams wouldn't come true.  I hated chemistry!  One of my English professors told me about auditions for a musical and that men were needed.  I've never liked musicals - I never cared to dance and sing at the same time - but I auditioned and that was some eight years ago."</p>
<p>Collin chose UT largely due to a desire to stay in the South.  He says, "After reading and hearing more about the program, I became more intrigued.  The focus on international study made the choice ideal.  Acting to me is being able to take experiences from one's self and others and apply them to the stage. Through the international program, having the opportunity to interact with different cultures is priceless."   Collin hopes that the training and connections that he gains at UT make him a more marketable asset in the theatre world, here in the US or internationally.</p>

<p><?= Image("Forrest D. Martin", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Forrest D. Martin</strong> was born and raised in Memphis, TN.  He did his undergraduate work at Dillard University in New Orleans, LA, majoring in theatre with a minor in mass communications.  He was really attracted to the graduate program at UT because of the international theatre component of the program.  His first trip ever overseas was the recent graduate student trip to Salzburg, Austria.  He says, "The chance to study abroad was a big pro in my selection of UT."</p>
<p>Forrest became interested in acting as a child, when he played Dopey in <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> in the first grade.  From then on, he performed in a lot of church-related plays (Sunday School sketches, Vacation Bible School plays, Easter plays, etc.) and school plays.  He attended a performing arts high school, and his first year in high school was the time when he realized he wanted to make a career out of acting. After finishing the program at UT, Forrest says, "I plan to become a full time actor by way of constant auditioning and moving to a city in which I can have the opportunity to try and establish myself as an actor in theatre, TV, and films.  My heart will more than likely keep me in touch with providing quality theatre to children and helping children appreciate the arts and theatre more."  He adds, "I do not want to teach.  I just want to keep a strong relationship with the youth to teach them the many ways they can express themselves in the theatre."</p>

<p><?= Image("Juan Salvati", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Juan Salvati</strong> was born in Temperly in the Buenos Aires province of Argentina.  He has many years of experience as a poet, singer, and actor, and describes his non-traditional approach to acting as being "inextricably linked with the 'independent flavor' and veritable thirst for social progressive changes within the Argentine theatre community."  When he was 17 years old, in March 1976, Juan says, "the age of my innocence was violently interrupted" by a fierce, bloody military coup in Argentina.  He adds, "This gruesome disruption in our social fabric triggered, at such an early stage in my life, an even firmer conviction in terms of the indisputable, wholehearted defense of human rights and democratic values."</p>
<p>In February 1997, Juan met Elizabeth Craven and Tom Cooke in New York at the URTA auditions.  Juan notes that they were "the very first theatre artists since I arrived in the US in 1995 that not only were extremely kind, generous and supportive of me, but who also were so respectful of my cultural background and were honestly devoted to the development of an international theatre experience."  He was "promptly infatuated" with the UT Department of Theatre.  In early 2001, Juan contacted Terry Weber and arranged for the audition that led to his enrollment at UT, which he refers to as one of those "rewarding moments that roundly shifted the course of my entire life, enhancing my vision as a man of the theatre."</p>
<p>Juan has "rich and ambitious" goals for his future.  He hopes to become actively involved in the regional theatre movement in the US, but would also like to develop his own shows, "with the sole purpose of divulging and developing a thought-provoking, humanistic theatre that can realistically make a serious contribution toward better understanding between human beings."</p>

<p><?= Image("Jessenia She", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Jessenia She</strong> is originally from Dallas, TX.  She studied at the University of Dallas, where she majored in drama.  She became interested in acting when, after she graduated from high school, she auditioned for and was cast in <i>The Philadelphia Story</i> at a local community college.  It was her very first time on stage and she "loved every minute of it" and decided to pursue acting as a profession.  She says that "running into Elizabeth Craven repeatedly after auditions" was the first thing that attracted her to the program at UT.  Perhaps it was fate.  She says that she "couldn't pass up the opportunity to travel, learn abroad, and be a member of an international ensemble."  At the conclusion of her three years at UT, she hopes "to work in regional theatre, work overseas, teach, and raise a family."</p>

<p><?= Image("Anne Thibault", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Anne Thibault</strong> is originally from Toronto, ON and has lived in Pennsylvania, Chicago and Boston.  She considers herself a New Yorker, since that's where she's lived the longest.  She got her BFA in performing arts from Emerson College in Boston.  She says "I got my start in acting when I was cut from the field hockey team in ninth grade for using language unbefitting a Catholic school girl."  So she auditioned for the school play instead and was cast as a devil named Slumtrimpet in C.S. Lewis' <i>The Screwtape Letters</i>.</p>
<p>Anne worked with Blake Robison at the National Shakespeare Company in New York, and heard about UT's graduate program in performance when Blake became the department head here.  She says "I was really interested in the international focus of the program and also in the fact that the program is run by a strong woman."</p>
<p>Anne plans to move back to New York after completing the program here.  She says, "Moving to Knoxville was a huge culture shock!"  She is interested in primarily making a living at acting, but also in working with a company that allows multi-disciplinary exploration within the theatre.</p>

<p><?= Image("Alecia White", "align='left' border=1") ?><strong>Alecia White</strong> grew up in Buffalo, IA, "with lots of green fields and open spaces."  She says, "It was a very peaceful place to grow up - I always had lots of room to run."</p>
<p>She did her undergraduate work at Jordan College of Fine Arts at Butler University in Indianapolis, IN.  She majored in music education (choral/general K-12) with an emphasis in voice and piano, and minored in theatre.  She also spent some time in Melbourne, Australia, studying film and Australian studies at the University of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Alecia became interested in acting and the performing arts when she was a little girl.  She says, "My parents are musical performers, and always encouraged their children in those areas, so my sister and I spent our 'littler' days creating plays, dances, concerts, and talk shows in our basement.  I started acting and singing then and just never stopped!"</p>
<p>Alecia says that she was attracted to the graduate program at UT because of "the international aspect of the program, the affiliation with the Clarence Brown Theatre, and the warm personalities of Beth and Blake when I auditioned for them in Chicago.  I really felt like they took time with me and really followed up after the audition, and many of the other graduate schools I auditioned for were not as personal."</p>
<p>Some of Alecia's goals and ambitions after finishing the program at UT include "moving to a major city (New York or Chicago probably), auditioning as much as possible, trying my hand at the 'starving artist' life, perhaps using my teaching license and/or teaching private music lessons in my home, doing some Christian mission work, and basically just beginning to live outside of the safe haven of a university!  Oh, I also plan to get a puppy, and if that works out, maybe a boyfriend."</p>
