<p>The Department of Theatre strives to stretch the limits of theatre education.  Special workshops and performances are produced by the Department of Theatre for our students, and sometime even for the whole community.</p>

<p>Also, our professors are constantly inspiring us with their own projects throughout the US and across the seas.</p>

<p>Here's what going on right now.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Theatre travels to Salzburg!</strong></p>

<p>Five faculty members and fourteen MFA design and performance students spent three weeks at the Schloss Leopoldskron in Salzburg (this is the palace featured as the home of the von Trapp family in the film THE SOUND OF MUSIC).  Approximately 10 important European designers, directors and actors presented short seminars for the students. Additionally, the design students visited the great art museums of Munich and Vienna.  The entire group will attend a performance of MARY STUART at the Burg Theater (the Federal Theater of Austria) in Vienna, designed by one of our guest artists, Susanne Raschig.  The group also traveled to Stuttgart, Germany to see a Monteverdi opera at the Stuttgart Opera.</p>
