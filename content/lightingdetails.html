The mock exam results will determine the success or failure of the thesis project.</p>

<h2>Study Abroad</h2>
<p>Students may elect to spend one semester of their program in a foreign exchange. Students who have not studied German, Polish, or Spanish must be prepared to take up to two semesters and a summer of language study to qualify for the exchange.</p>

<p>As a design student at the University of Tennessee, you will have the unique opportunity to fulfill your potential as a designer that can include supported study and travel in Europe and opportunities to work with some of the finest directors from this country and others.</p>
<p>Coursework is supplemented by a number of workshops with guest artists and craftspeople from this country and abroad. You will be challenged to become intellectually, artistically, and technically prepared to work in the environment you choose.  As a student at the University of Tennessee, you will be educated to design costumes and sets that are dramaturgical extensions of the play, not merely decorative or illustrative elements.</p>
