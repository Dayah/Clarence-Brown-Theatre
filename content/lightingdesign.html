<p>The program will accept 2 new students every other year. This will allow an in-depth course curriculum to be taught and still control the consistency of recruitment and turnover. This outline may be adapted to students' individual strengths, weaknesses and personal interests. Lighting design students are encouraged to design at least two realized productions each semester. The most effective teaching tool is experience.  Students will also be expected to travel with faculty as they work on professional projects around the country. The overall strength of this program is its diversity of experience.</p>
