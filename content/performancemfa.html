<h2>Professional Affiliation</h2>

<p>The University of Tennessee is one of the few drama schools in the country affiliated with a professional LORT Company - The Clarence Brown Theatre Company. For over a quarter-century, this regional Equity Company had offered classics, contemporary plays, musicals, and cutting-edge international work to the theatrical community. All MFA candidates work with the professional company during their first and second years. In the third year, selected students may join the CBT acting company or pursue an intern year at another professional theatre. The Clarence Brown Theatre allows students regular opportunities to work alongside professional actors while earning membership in the Actors' Equity Association.</p>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>

<p>The MFA in Performance at the University of Tennessee embraces a two-fold mission: to provide eclectic and broad-based actor training which exposes students to a unique set of theatrical tools and equips them to compete successfully in the theatre profession of today, while simultaneously creating an ensemble environment which nurtures individual risk-taking and self-knowledge.</p>

<h2>Your Goals</h2>

<p>Today's theatre is highly competitive and requires actors to possess stamina, mastery of craft, and a working knowledge of the business of the profession. We provide you with the tools and the environment to help you succeed.  We also believe that of equal or greater importance than vocational skills is the development of the artist within. A training school can provide a place where students may take the time to contemplate their own philosophy of theatre and to go deeper into their reason for choosing an artistic life. As teachers, we strive to empower students as artists for whom the value of their own voices is of utmost importance. By embracing this goal, you take an active approach to your own development.  You become a better maker of theatre.</p>

<h2>International Work</h2>

<p>MFA students receive numerous opportunities to travel and study abroad.   Student participation in international theatre festivals and conferences exposes them to a wide variety of approaches and performance styles. In past years, students have performed at festivals in such countries as France, Hungary, Korea, Romania, and Slovakia.  At the same time, the Clarence Brown Theatre hosts a variety of international guest artists who offer master classes and workshops throughout the year.</p>

<h2>Financial Package</h2>

<p>The MFA acting program is highly selective and accepts only 6-10 students per class.  All MFA candidates receive a full tuition waiver, an annual stipend of $8,000 and up to $1,500 for national and international travel.  This financial package is supplemented by generous scholarships awarded annually.</p>
