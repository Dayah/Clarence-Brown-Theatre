<p>There are all kinds of performances happening at the Clarence Brown Theatre.  The professional series sponsored by the UT Department of Theatre provides a seven-play season beginning in September and running though June.</p>

<p>The Department of Theatre also sponsors workshops, special performances and hosts guest artists.</p>

<p>In addition, our students are always providing performances for the general public through All Campus Theatre or other student projects performed in the CBT lab theatre.</p>

<p>And if that's not enough entertainment for you, other UT and community organizations use the Clarence Brown Theatre as their performance venue.</p>
