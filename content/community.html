<p>At the Clarence Brown Theatre at the University of Tennessee, we recognize the positive impact that the performing arts have on young people.  Educational outreach is an integral part of the CBT's mission.  Every season, we offer student matinee performances, backstage tours, career education programs, in-school artist residencies, and workshops and discussion groups for teachers and the entire community.  Through our outreach activities, we bring live theatre into the community, and help to develop a new generation of culturally educated community members.</p>
