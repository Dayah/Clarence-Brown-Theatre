<p><a href="http://web.utk.edu/~theatre/">All Campus Theatre</a> (ACT) is an organization set up to provide theatre experiences to all students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Each year, ACT presents three to four full-length shows and a Night of One-Act Plays. Also, each semester the organization hosts "All Night Theatre," a time for members to come together and perform whatever they want from midnight until the theatre clears out.</p>
