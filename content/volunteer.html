<p>The CBT relies on volunteer help for various tasks such as assistance with costumes, scenery, ushering and crew for each of the shows as well as mailing, data entry, and special events.  Please call 974-2485 or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:cbt@utk.edu">cbt@utk.edu</a> to become a part of this fun and important group of people and help the Clarence Brown Theatre at the same time!</p>

<h2>Ushering</h2>
<p><em>Usher at any CBT play and receive free admittance to the show!</em></p>
<p>There are at least 15 shows for each of the Clarence Brown Theatre productions during our season.  That means we need 10 volunteers for every show to tear tickets, show people to their seats, and help out behind the refreshment counter.  Everyone who helps gets to see the show for free!  You can volunteer to usher by yourself, with a friend, or as part of a group.  Call the CBT Box Office at 974-5161 to volunteer to usher.</p>

<h2>Office Assistance</h2>
<p>We use volunteer help in our business office for mailings and data entry.  Usually this work is done from your home - we just ask that you pick up the materials at the theatre and take it from there.  We send out many mailings each year and our volunteers help us reach our subscription goals each year.  Call 974-2485 to volunteer to help us with our mailings.</p>

<h2>Scene Shop</h2>
<p>Volunteers are often needed in the Scene Shop. The skill level required varies from almost no experience to highly skilled carpentry and/or steel work. Volunteers frequently assist in sanding, filling and base painting scenery. More experienced volunteers may construct wooden or steel scenery. Any skill level is welcome for taking down the scenery after the production is over&mdash;aka "strike."  Normal shop hours are M-F, 8 am - 5 pm. For more information, please contact Marty Cooke at 974-2197 or <a href="mailto:mcooke@utk.edu">e-mail him</a> to see how you can help.</p>

<h2>Costume Shop</h2>
<p>Can you sew on a button?  How about iron?  We're looking for assistance in our shops during the construction times (6 weeks before each of the shows) to help sew, darn and iron.  Call Jeffrey Todhunter at 974-2203 or <a href="mailto:jtodhunter@utk.edu">e-mail him</a> for more information on volunteering in the costume shop.</p>

<h2>Lighting</h2>
<p>Have you ever been interested in working behind the scenes with lighting?  Now's your chance!  Our lighting and electrics department needs dependable people to be trained and work the shows during our season.  Call John Horner at 974-8980 or <a href="mailto:jhorner00@utk.edu">e-mail him</a> for more information on volunteering in the lighting and electric shop.</p>

<h2>Sound</h2>
<p>We need dependable people to assist with each of the shows in running the soundboard and assisting our sound engineer with pre-performance sound issues.  No experience required!  Just call Mike Ponder at 974-1479 or <a href="mailto:mponder1@utk.edu">e-mail him</a> and leave a message.</p>
