<h2>Parking</h2>
<p>Patrons are encouraged to park in Staff Lot 23 (see map below). Staff Lot 23 is located behind the Clarence Brown Theatre on the corner of Pat Head Summit Road and Andy Holt Avenue.  If this lot is full, the upper level of the parking garage under McClung Tower on Volunteer Boulevard is available.  A police officer is at the entrance to the parking garage to let you in and out of the garage.</p>
<p>If there is a major event on campus at the same time as your performance, parking services attendants will be at each of the entrances to the parking lot and can help direct you to available parking.  As a subscriber, you will need to present your parking voucher.  As a single-ticket buyer, you will need to pay $5 to park in the lot behind the theatre.</p>
