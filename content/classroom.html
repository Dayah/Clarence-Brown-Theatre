<p>Clarence Brown Theatre and UT Department of Theatre professionals are available to conduct a variety of school-based residencies and workshops that fit your needs and the needs of your students.  For all workshops and residencies, we will schedule a planning session between you and the artist who will be working with your class.</p>

<p>A two or three visit residency will bring your reading list to life as one of our professionals gets your students up on their feet, performing great works of literature.</p>

<p>Or - you can tell us what your class needs.  From acting basics to advanced performance techniques or any of the technical aspects of theatre, your students will be taught by the best theatre professionals.</p>
