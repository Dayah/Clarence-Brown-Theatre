<h2>The Program</h2>

<p>The MFA in Design at the University of Tennessee offers students the opportunity to learn the highest standards of practice in a professional theatre setting. The faculty of this three-year conservatory program is composed of working professionals and scholars with extensive national and international connections. Our interdisciplinary approach provides academic and practical training with the goal of producing an accomplished MFA graduate who can take his or her place in the professional world immediately upon graduation, whether in New York, in regional theatres or on a college or university faculty.</p>

<p>Students in the program have opportunities to work with both the university theatre and the Clarence Brown Theatre Company, a regional LORT theatre associated with the university.  In addition, there are opportunities for study abroad and work on international projects with domestic and international artists. Most students accepted into the program receive a tuition waiver, an $8,000 assistantship stipend, and as much as $1,500 per year in travel support for study trips abroad, attendance at European theatre festivals, or at regional, national, or international theatre conferences.</p>

<p>Facilities at the University of Tennessee include the Clarence Brown Theatre, a 576-seat proscenium space; the Ula Love Doughty Carousel Theatre, a 350-seat arena space; and a well-equipped laboratory theatre.  Professionally staffed scene, costume and lighting shops support work produced in these theatre spaces.</p>

<p>The Department of Theatre at the University of Tennessee is large enough to support a wide range of design and technology interests, yet small enough to provide flexible individualized attention to the unique needs of each student in the program.  Graduates of this program are working in New York and in regional theatres and universities around the country, and have been regularly recognized with awards from such organizations as USITT, TCG, ACTF, and the Southeastern Theatre Conference.</p>
