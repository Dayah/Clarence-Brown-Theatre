<p><?= Image("Faculty Players", "align='left' border=1") ?>The history of a theatre program at the University began at least a half century ago when the English Department formally assisted the U.T. Playhouse, a student dramatic group, in producing plays.  Dr. Paul Soper was assigned the responsibility for production.  Prior to that, groups of students and faculty had from time to time formed dramatic clubs and produced plays - the first as early as 1840.<?= Image("Newspaper Article", "align='right' border=1") ?></p>

<p>The English Department Head, Dr. John Hodges, appointed Dr. Soper, a teacher in the English Department since 1936, to the position of Theatre Director in 1939.  In the 40's and 50's, with the assistance of Fred Fields and Russell Green, the foundation was laid for the present program in theatre. [INSERT PIC OF DR. SOPER, AND FRED FIELDS] In 1940-41 a one-year course in theatre, in which acting, stagecraft, play interpretation and directing were offered, was introduced into the English curriculum.  From the time the program in theatre grew in spite of the lack of any adequate facility on campus for the presentation of plays.</p>

<p>Theatre supporters began to urge the administration that a suitable permanent facility be created for production on campus and to replace Ayres Hall, Tyson House, the Bijou Theatre, and Tyson Junior High School.</p>

<p>After the successful Knoxville Junior League production of <i>The Women</i> at the Bijou, produced in conjunction with the University, Dr. Soper planned a series of summer plays that would combine U.T.'s talent with that of the community.  In the summer of 1951 the University, the Junior League, and other community volunteers erected a tent and named it the Carousel Theatre because of its arena design.</p>

<p>The summer experiment was very successful, and it was clear that a permanent theatre could fill community and university needs.  Dr. Soper and other UT officials decided to make plans for a permanent facility.  In December 1951, UT trustees approved the financing for a building.</p>

<p>During the next two decades the Carousel Theatre program expanded to include thirteen productions annually, two hundred performances that involved over three hundred roles, and a total attendance in excess of seventy thousand people.  The Children's Carousel, a series of plays especially for school children, began in 1953.  The training received by the participants in these plays and the interest stimulated in the young audiences is credited by many for the growth and success of U.T. Theatres.  "Kiddie Carousel," as it was frequently called, helped create an audience.</p>

<p>During this time performance and technical courses were limited in number and general in nature, but emphasis on scholarship was higher than it had ever been.  The course of study was drawn from an interdisciplinary body including classes from the Department of Audiology and Speech Pathology, Department of Classics and the English Department.</p>

<p><?= Image("Clarence Brown", "align='left' border=1") ?>The next impetus for the program was the building of the Clarence Brown Theatre in 1970.  Again, it was through the initiative and energy of Paul Soper that this valuable production and training facility was established. With the help of the famous Hollywood director, <?= LinkTo("aboutclarence.html", "Clarence Brown") ?>, the University of Tennessee built the Clarence Brown Theatre for the Performing Arts.</p>

<p>The Clarence Brown Theatre for the Performing Arts at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, was formally dedicated during ceremonies November 13 and 14, 1970.  Heralded as one of the finest facilities in the nation, the theatre is one of the showplaces of the UT Knoxville campus.</p>

<p>When Dr. Soper stepped down in 1972, Ralph Allen was appointed head and charged by the Dean of Liberal Arts to expand the faculty was well as the production program of the department.</p>

<p>Allen, with the presence of Anthony Quayle as co-founder, inaugurated the Clarence Brown Theatre Company, a LORT B company.  With grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the presence of Quayle as star, the Company made extensive tours throughout the southeast.  In 1976 the production of <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>, starring Quayle and directed by Joshua Logan, played at the Kennedy Center.  At times other company members included: Zoe Caldwell, Dame Judith Anderson, Mary Martin, Orson Bean, June Havoc, Earl Hyman, and Eva LeGallienne.  A number of plays "tried out" in the Clarence Brown Theatre and then moved to New York.  The most success was the <i>New Majestic Follies</i>, written and directed by Ralph Allen.  On Broadway it became the popular review, <i>Sugar Babies</i>.  Others included <i>Do You Turn Somersaults</i>? Starring Quayle and Mary Martin and <i>A Meeting By The River</i> featuring Simon War, Siobhan McKenna, and Sam Jaffe.</p>

<p>During Allen's tenure the Faculty became more specialized, creating areas of concentration and preparing the way for professional training through the MFA program.</p>

<p>In 1978 Lorayne Lester became Head of the Department of Speech and Theatre.  Under her leadership, the new Master of Fine Arts Degree program accepted 11 students for its first class in the Fall of 1980.</p>

<p>In 1985, Peter Garvie became head of UT Theatres and Lorayne Lester was promoted to Dean of Arts &amp; Sciences.  UT Theatres was designated a Center of Excellence by the Tennessee Higher Education Commission.  The award brought new state funding to the program for the 85-86 academic year, to be matched on a 1:2 basis by the University.  The funding was used in a variety of ways: <i>The Questions of Hamlet</i>, adapted by Peter Garvie, toured fourteen communities in Tennessee; the <i>Christmas Carol</i> set was funded in its entirety for its premiere; nine undergraduates and two graduate assistantships were financed; a number of theatre related acquisitions.</p>

<p>5 different people held the position of Department Head for Speech and Theatre between 1968 and 1987. In order of succession, they were Paul Soper, Ralph Allen, Lorayne Lester, G. Allan Yeomans and Peter Garvie.  Bob Mashburn was Acting Head during the academic year 1986-87.  Bob Mashburn and Lorayne Lester, from the speech communication division, made final plans for creation of separate departments.  Then theatre became a separate department in 1987, Thomas Cooke was appointed Head.</p>

<p>Under the direction of Thomas Cooke, the Department of Theatre hosts and co-sponsors a number of international theatre events, including the International Theatre Festival.  Several world premieres are produced and MFA students travel to Bratislava to participate in the biennial Festival Istropolitana and the International Theatre Festival in Budapest, Hungary.  A conference, "Actor Training: International Perspectives", is held at UT.  Representatives from more than 17 countries participated in discussions of international actor training programs.</p>

<p>When Dr. Cooke stepped down in 1999, long-time professor Bill Black became the Acting Head.  Blake Robison was appointed Department Head in 2000 and continues to lead the theatre into the new century.</p>
