<p>As Opening Night Club members, we delight in theatre. We are always the first to see the curtain rise on every spectacular show at Knoxville's most prestigious professional venue.  After the performance, we mingle with actors, directors, and designers, as well as with our friends and neighbors right here in our own community.</p>

<p>Our support helps to provide each piece of scenery and a dazzling array of costumes for every performance.  We fill out the orchestra, provide the best director for each production, and sweep the spotlights onto the stage.</p>

<p>And we have a strong sense of community responsibility.  We provide matinees for schoolchildren and scholarships for UT theatre students.  Every time we applaud a new show, we assist in the education of a young artist, just beginning the long journey of a career in the performing arts.</p>

<p>We have several levels of support available for both individuals and corporations.  All but the ticket portion of your gift is tax-deductible.
