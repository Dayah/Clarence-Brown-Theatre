<p>The CBT production program boasts three performance facilities:</p>

<p><strong>The Clarence Brown Theatre</strong> is a 576-seat proscenium theatre built in 1970 and dedicated to Clarence Brown, University of Tennessee alumnus and distinguished film director. The building, located in the center of UT's campus, also houses the costume, light, sound and scene shops. The theatre provides seating for the physically challenged and listening systems for the deaf and hearing impaired.</p>

<p><strong>The Ula Love Doughty Carousel Theatre</strong>, one of the nation's first arena theatres, is a versatile 350-seat space featuring flexible seating and staging. Located next to the Clarence Brown Theatre, the Carousel Theatre was renamed in October 1991 in tribute to Mrs. Doughty, a devoted patron who has provided for the building's future.</p>

<p><strong>The Clarence Brown Lab Theatre</strong> is a 100-seat black box venue located inside the Clarence Brown Theatre. The Lab Theatre is used as a classroom space and serves as home to productions sponsored by All Campus Theatre (ACT) and productions directly related to undergraduate and graduate class projects.</p>
